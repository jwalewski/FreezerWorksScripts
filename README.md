FreezerWorks made easier

The functions contained in the notebook extend the functionality of FreezerWorks, a program that Yale School of Medicine uses for sample management.
While it is effective at maintaining the database for our samples, these functions manipulate the generic CSV output into formats that are instantly compatible for our use cases.
These functions can also parse multiple CSV inputs from our collaborators, UCSF and Dana Farber, to mass import samples into FreezerWorks.
